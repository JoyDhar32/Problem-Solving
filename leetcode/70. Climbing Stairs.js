 Example: n=4
Initialization:
a (prev1) is initialized to 1.
b (prev2) is initialized to 2.

First Iteration (i = 3):
Calculate presentStep as the sum of a and b: presentStep = 1 + 2 = 3.
Update a (prev1) to the value of b for the next iteration: a = 2.
Update b (prev2) to the value of presentStep for the next iteration: b = 3.

Second Iteration (i = 4):
Calculate presentStep as the sum of a and b: presentStep = 2 + 3 = 5.
Update a (prev1) to the value of b for the next iteration: a = 3.
Update b (prev2) to the value of presentStep for the next iteration: b = 5.

Result:
After the loop, the final result is stored in b, which is 5.
