// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n) because we are using a set to store the numbers
//âœ… Hints: Use a set to store the numbers you have seen so far. If you encounter a number that is already in the set, add it to the output array. Stop once you have found two numbers in the output array.
